# PJS4-client
Client side for PJS4 Arenouille, an online video game adaptation of the board game *Arena: for the Gods!*.
You can check the server side repository here : [pjs4-arena-api](https://github.com/Aleryc/pjs4-arena-api/tree/client-server-communication).

## Branches
- `master`

The game isn't in stable stage so there is nothing on master.

- `dev`

Development branch, it only contains the work for the console version (no interface).

- `unity`

Same as Dev but there are only the sources.
